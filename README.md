# Stock Market Dashboard

## Description
A stock market dashboard enabling users to select ticker symbols to view the price action of stocks listed and traded on US exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).

## Implementation
Select a stock ticker (e.g. AAPL for Apple stock) from the drop down menu, as well as start and end dates.

Hovering over the graph displays the closing price for the company at each day of trading, and it is possible to compare the price action of multiple companies.
